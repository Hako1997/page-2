title: Restoration strategy for active distribution systems considering
  endogenous uncertainty in cold load pickup
abstract: Cold load pickup (CLPU) phenomenon is identified as the persistent
  power inrush upon a sudden load pickup after an outage. Under the active
  distribution system (ADS) paradigm, where distributed energy resources (DERs)
  are extensively installed, the decreased outage duration can induce a strong
  interdependence between CLPU pattern and load pickup decisions. In this paper,
  we propose a novel modelling technique to tractably capture the
  decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU) inherent in the CLPU process.
  Subsequently, a two-stage stochastic decision-dependent service restoration
  (SDDSR) model is constructed, where first stage searches for the optimal
  switching sequences to decide step-wise network topology, and the second stage
  optimizes the detailed generation schedule of DERs as well as the energization
  of switchable loads. Moreover, to tackle the computational burdens introduced
  by mixed-integer recourse, the progressive hedging algorithm (PHA) is utilized
  to decompose the original model into scenario-wise subproblems that can be
  solved in parallel. The numerical test on modified IEEE 123-node test feeders
  has verified the efficiency of our proposed SDDSR model and provided fresh
  insights into the monetary and secure values of DDU quantification.
